    <h1>Binary Search Trees</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary trees have nodes with at most two children each</li>
        <li>Binary search trees have nodes on left with keys smaller than root key</li>
        <li>Binary search trees have nodes on right with keys larger than root key</li>
    </ul>

    <p>trees:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nodes containing pointers to child node(s)</li>
        <li>Non-linear (unlike lists)</li>
        <li>Nodes can have no children, a single child, or multiple children.</li>
        <li>Only parent->child relationship; Cannot point to parent/sibling nodes (unlike graphs)</li>
        <li>Trees need to have one root (root node).</li>
        <li>"Leaves" are nodes with no children.</li>
        <li>Edge - Connection between one node and another</li>
        <li>Examples include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML DOM</li>
            <li>Network routing</li>
            <li>Abstract syntax trees (for programming language abstractions)</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>OS folders and computer file systems</li>
            <li>JSON</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Big O</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insertion - O(log n)</li>
        <li>Searching - O(log n)</li>
    </ul>
